===Install:===

  * cd /var/www

  * tar -xzvf asterisk-cdr-viewer.tgz OR svn checkout http://asterisk-cdr-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ asterisk-cdr-viewer

  * cp asterisk-cdr-viewer/contrib/httpd/asterisk-cdr-viewer.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/

  * service restart httpd

  * change settings in /var/www/asterisk-cdr-viewer/include/config.inc.php

  * open browser with url  http://your_ip/acdr/

===Recording interface===

To display the links to the recorded files:

  * change the following settings in configuration file ( config.inc.php ):
    # *$system_monitor_dir = '/var/spool/asterisk/monitor';* - is the directory where call recordings are stored 
    # *$system_audio_format = 'wav';* - audio file format
  *  Use like this command to start recording ( in asterisk dialplan ):
{{{
[macro-monitor]
exten => s,1,Set(MONITOR_FILE=/var/spool/asterisk/monitor/${UNIQUEID})
exten => s,n,MixMonitor(${MONITOR_FILE}.wav,b)
}}}

_if you use a different file format, see more examples in [http://code.google.com/p/asterisk-cdr-viewer/source/browse/trunk/include/config.inc.php#51 config.inc.php ( function formatFiles)]_

===CSV dump===

  * To enable the CSV dump run the following sql command:
   _GRANT FILE ON `*`.`*` to 'cdrasterisk'@'localhost';_

===Regular expressions===

    If an Source / Destination number is prefixed by a '`_`'
    character, it is interpreted as a pattern rather than a
    literal. In patterns, some characters have special meanings:

  * X - any digit from 0-9
  * Z - any digit from 1-9
  * N - any digit from 2-9
  * [1235-9] - any digit in the brackets (in this example, 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9)
  * . - wildcard, matches anything remaining (e.g. `_`9011. matches anything starting with 9011 excluding 9011 itself)

    For example, the Source/Destination `_`NXXXXXX would match 7 digit numbers,
    while `_`1NXXNXXXXXX would represent an area code plus phone number
    preceded by a one.


====This cdr-viewer supports the processing of multiple regular expressions in the Source/Destination name separated by a comma.====

    For example:

        * Source = `'_2XXN, _562., _.0075'`  - src is any of these numbers


===Multiple user access===

  * uncomment following section in http.conf file:
{{{
    #<Location "/acdr/">
    #   AuthName "Asterisk-CDR-Stat"
    #   AuthType Basic
    #   AuthUserFile /var/www/asterisk-cdr-viewer/.htpasswd
    #   AuthGroupFile /dev/null
    #   require valid-user
    #</Location>
}}}

  * add admin user, for example (iokunev) :
      htpasswd -c /var/www/asterisk-cdr-viewer/.htpasswd iokunev

      add admin name to include/config.inc.php: $admin_user_names = "admin1,admin2,iokunev"
    <font color='red'>!!! $admin_user_names = '`*`' - all registered users are administrators. !!!</font>

    access for all CDRs: http://your_ip/acdr/ - with login iokunev

  * add user 2280:
     htpasswd  /var/www/asterisk-cdr-viewer/.htpasswd 2280 test

    access for incomming/outgoing (cid or did=2280) calls for this user: http://your_ip/acdr/ - with login 2280
